Boston Housing:

Python code is used to detect median value owner occupied homes in \$1000s using linear regression method

Method 1: Linear Regression
Method 2: Random Forest

Step 1: Audited the file to detect data types & missing values

Step 2: Verifying the skewness of the data to find inter dependencies between the input variables

Step 3: Replacing the missing values either by replacing with most repeating values or by mean of the column datas

Step 4: Developing a model using methods mentioned above

Step 5: Predicting the output using RMSE(Root Mean Squared Error)

Step 6: Implementing the model on test dataset
